Parameters and rock properties that you need in your North Sea term-project
****************************************************************************


	Effective pressure at reservoir depth = ca. 20 MPa
	(or you can calculate: p_eff=rho_ma*9.8*depth - rho_fluid*9.8*depth)
	Assuming hydrostatic pressure.

	Temperature at reservoir depth = 77.2 degrees Celcius. 

	Fluid properties:

		brine density: 1.09 g/cm3
		brine bulk modulus: 2.8 GPa

		oil density 0.78 g/cm3
		oil gravity: 32 API
		GOR:	64

	Rock properties:

		quartz mineral bulk modulus:  36.8 GPa
		quartz mineral shear modulus: 44 GPa

		clay bulk modulus: 	15 GPa
		clay shear modulus:	5 GPa

	You will need to calculate the fluid bulk modulus of oil before you do pore fluid substitution. This can be done on a the package Petrotools or using srbtools on Matlab. We will show you how to do that later. 

	Mineral moduli will also be needed in Gassmann modeling. Furthermore 
they will be needed in Rock diagnostics.
